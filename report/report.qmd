# The Disparity in Adolescent Health by Gender

**The Disparity in Adolescent Health by Gender**

Teenage life can be challenging, but for many females worldwide, it’s considerably more so. The gender-based differences in teenage health outcomes are shown in this graphic. Girls suffer obstacles stemming from inequality in many nations, including restricted access to protection, education, and healthcare. In some regions, boys may also be at danger for violence, work, or conflict.

These lines show actual differences in the experiences of young people with regard to opportunity, safety, and health; they are more than just statistics. To close these gaps, we must first understand them.
